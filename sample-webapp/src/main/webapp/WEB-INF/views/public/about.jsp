	<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger; margin-top:0px">Adesina A. Lalude</p>	
	<p>
	In September 2010 Adesina joined Capgemini Consulting's Global Team where he reported to the firm's
	CEO and helped its C-suite executives lead global strategic initiatives on branding, staffing, and 
	technology for the $3bn business. Prior to joining Capgemini Adesina pursued an MBA at Harvard 
	Business School where he focused on entrepreneurship and the customer experience.
	</p>
	<p>
	Prior to his MBA Adesina spent four years in China where he helped grow a Beijing-based technology 
	services outsourcing company from a 600-employee, $8mm revenue firm to a 5,000+ employee, $500mm 
	industry leader that IPOed on the NYSE in 2007.
	</p>
	<p>
	In addition to his MBA Adesina holds degrees in Business Administration and Computer Science & Engineering
	from the University of Southern California where his studies focused on finance, hardware 
	architecture, and large scale software systems.

	<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger; margin-top:0px">Neale Upstone</p>	

	<p>
	Neale is a problem solver at heart.  He sees a problem and cannot resist finding
	ways to make things work better.  From as a child modifying go-karts and bikes,
	to building what is possibly still the only ever graphics accelerator for the 
	Sinclair Spectrum!
	</p>
	<p>
	Neale has an M.A. in Electrical and Information Sciences from Cambridge University,
	from where he graduated to work with high tech consultancy, Cambridge Consultants,
	solving altogether more expensive problems, such as how to have software perform
	fast enough for the exacting requirements of the US military for one of the most 
	advanced real-time missile tracking systems.
	</p>
	<p>
	More recently he has been acting as a software troubleshooter for firms around the world,
	ranging from banks and telcos in North America needing help, to assisting the
	Financial Times with improving their agility and continuity of service at ft.com.
